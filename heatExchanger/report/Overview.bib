  abstract     = {To provide a favorable temperature for a power battery liquid cooling system, a bionic blood vessel structure of the power battery liquid cooling plate is designed based on the knowledge of bionics and the human blood vessel model. For three different discharge rates of 1C, 2C, and 3C, {FLUENT} is used to simulate and analyze the heat dissipation performance of the liquid cooling plate with a bionic vascular structure. The inﬂuence of the pipe distance (A1 and A2) at the coolant outlet, the thickness of the liquid cooling plate, the inner pipe turning radius R of the pipe in the channel, and the mass ﬂow of coolant on the heat dissipation performance are studied. The results show that the pipe distance (A1 and A2), plate thickness, and inner pipe turning radius R have signiﬁcant effects on the heat dissipation of the liquid cooling plate, especially under a 3C discharge. In addition, the channel area at the coolant outlet also has great inﬂuence on the heat dissipation performance of the liquid cooling plate, and the variable width optimization of the channel area at the outlet greatly improves the heat dissipation performance of the liquid cooling plate. Increasing the inlet mass ﬂow rate can improve the heat dissipation capacity, but at the expense of a pressure drop. A veriﬁcation experiment is designed for 3C discharge. The results show that the error between the experiment and simulation results is within 9.8\%; therefore, the simulation is accurate, and the liquid cooling plate has a signiﬁcant heat dissipation effect.},

The nanoﬂuid consisted of an aqueous suspension of the spherical-shaped alumina nanoparticles with the particle volume fraction (φ) ranging from 0.25\% to 1\%. The analysis has been performed by considering a heat sink comprising the staggered arrangement of 72 micropin-ﬁns of the circular cross-section without tip clearance. A constant heat ﬂux of 300 {kW}/m2 was subjected at the base of the heat sink, whilst the utilised pressure drop (ΔP) across the heat sink was limited to ΔPb3000Pa. Heat transfer and ﬂuid ﬂow parameters were evaluated in terms of the local heat transfer coefﬁcient, the enhancement ratio of the average convective heat transfer coefﬁcient, thermal resistance and volume ﬂow rate through the heat sink. Additionally, the temperature contours and ﬂow streamlines across the heat sink elaborated the temperature distribution and ﬂow attributes. Results indicated that under identical ΔP conditions, replacing water coolants with nanoﬂuids optimised the thermal performance of the heat sink with a perceptible margin at the higher particle loadings. At the optimal pressure drop and particle concentration, nanoparticle dispersion into the hosting ﬂuid demonstrated a maximum of 16\% enhancement in the average heat transfer coefﬁcient.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization is a powerful methodology for generating novel designs with a high degree of design freedom. In exchange for this attractive feature, topology optimization cannot generally avoid multimodality, which often impedes finding a satisfactory solution when dealing with strongly nonlinear optimization problems. In this study, we focus on constructing a framework that aims to indirectly solve such complex topology optimization problems. The framework is based on multifidelity topology design ({MFTD}), the basic concept of which is to divide solving an original topology optimization problem into two kinds of procedures, i.e., low-fidelity optimization and high-fidelity evaluation. We build the framework as a data-driven approach, where the design candidates given by solving the low-fidelity optimization problem are iteratively updated based on the idea of the evolutionary algorithm ({EA}). As a key procedure to realize a crossover-like operation in the high-dimensional design space, a variational autoencoder—one of the representative deep generative models—is utilized for generating a new dataset composed of various material distributions. Besides, we propose a mutation-like operation for generating novel material distributions based on reference ones in the dataset. By integrating these operations with an elitism-based selection procedure, we propose data-driven {MFTD} that enables gradient-free optimization even if tackling a complex optimization problem with a high degree of design freedom. We apply the proposed framework to forced convection heat transfer problems, where the low-fidelity optimization problem is formulated using a Darcy flow model, whereas the high-fidelity evaluation is conducted using a Navier–Stokes model. We first demonstrate that the obtained results from the proposed framework can achieve almost identical performance compared with that of the directly solved results in a well-known 2D laminar heat transfer problem. We then show that the proposed framework can find solutions in minimax problems of topology optimization pertaining to 3D laminar and turbulent heat transfer.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a detailed literature review on the thermal management issue faced by electronic devices, particularly concerning uneven heating and overheating problems. Special focus is given to the design and structural optimization of heat sinks for efﬁcient single-phase liquid cooling. Firstly, the paper highlights the common presence and detrimental consequences of electronics overheating resulting from multiple heat sources, supported by various illustrative examples. Subsequently, the emphasis is placed on single-phase liquid cooling as one of the effective thermal management technologies for power electronics, as well as on the enhancement of heat transfer in micro/mini channel heat sinks. Various studies on the design and structural optimization of heat sinks are then analyzed and categorized into ﬁve main areas: (1) optimization of channel crosssection shape, (2) optimization of channel ﬂow passage, (3) ﬂow distribution optimization for parallel straight channel heat sinks, (4) optimization of pin-ﬁn shape and arrangement, and (5) topology optimization of global ﬂow conﬁguration. After presenting a broad and complete overview of the state of the art, the paper concludes with a critical analysis of the methods and results from the literature and highlights the research perspectives and challenges in the ﬁeld. It is shown that the issue of uneven and overheating caused by multiple heat sources, which is commonly observed in modern electronics, has received less attention in the literature compared to uniform or single-peak heating. While several design and structural optimization techniques have been implemented to enhance the cooling performance of heat sinks, topology optimization has experienced signiﬁcant advancements in recent years and appears to be the most promising technology due to its highest degree of freedom to treat the uneven heating problem. This paper can serve as an essential reference contributing to the development of liquid-cooling heat sinks for efﬁcient thermal management of electronics.},

To satisfy industrial demand, different trials have also been carried out for designing optimized fins. The optimization of fins can be performed either by enhancing heat dissipation at an exact fin weight or by diminishing the weight of the fin by precise heat dissipation. Recently a notable amount of work on some typical fins, like, porous fins and perforated fins, has also been carried out.

The considered physical situations involve a weak coupling between the Navier–Stokes equations for the velocity and the pressure in the ﬂuid, and the convection–diﬀusion equation for the temperature ﬁeld. The proposed framework combines several recent techniques from the ﬁeld of shape and topology optimization, and notably a level-set based mesh evolution algorithm for tracking shapes and their deformations, an eﬃcient optimization algorithm for constrained shape optimization problems, and a numerical method to handle a wide variety of geometric constraints such as thickness constraints and non-penetration constraints. Our strategy is applied to the optimization of various types of heat exchangers. At ﬁrst, we consider a simpliﬁed 2D cross-ﬂow model where the optimized boundary is the section of the hot ﬂuid phase ﬂowing in the transverse direction, which is naturally composed of multiple holes. A minimum thickness constraint is imposed on the cross-section so as to account for manufacturing and maximum pressure drop constraints. In a second part, we optimize the design of 2D and 3D heat exchangers composed of two types of ﬂuid channels (hot and cold), which are separated by a solid body. A non-mixing constraint between the ﬂuid components containing the hot and cold phases is enforced by prescribing a minimum distance between them. Numerical results are presented on a variety of test cases, demonstrating the eﬃciency of our approach in generating new, realistic, and unconventional heat exchanger designs.},

A continuing in increasing of power density in {CPU} processor, by reducing the size of electronic products has led to the importance of thermal management issue in this industry. This issue will reduce the performance of the {CPU} processor and indirectly affects the lifetime of the electronics package. In order to avoid these consequences, therefore, heat sink with high heat transfer rate is need. The selection of suitable heat sink geometries requires a compromise among the availability of space, weight, and cost as well as the heat transfer characteristics of the heat sink model surface. This study aims to provide the optimal arrangement of heat sink by using random approach that randomly generated the position of pin by visualized the thermal profile using {COMSOL} Multiphysics software. The finding of this study propose a new arrangement (optimal) of the pin fin that be able to give better thermal performance which are 2.84 percent and 0.63 percent compared to the conventional design, which is inline and staggered arrangement. To develop a simple and effective random approach arrangement can significantly contribute to the advancement of thermal performance solution and catering the industrial needs.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing ({AM}) has an affinity with topology optimization to think of various designs with complex structures. Hence, this paper aims to optimize the design of a lattice-structured heat sink, which can be manufactured by {AM}. The design objectives are to maximize the thermal performance of convective heat transfer in natural convection simulated by computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) and to minimize the material cost required for {AM} process at the same time. The lattice structure is represented as a node/edge system via graph theory with a moderate number of design variables. Bayesian optimization, which employs the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm {II} and the Kriging surrogate model, is conducted to search for better designs with the minimum {CFD} cost. The present topology optimization successfully finds better lattice-structured heat sink designs than a reference fin-structured design regarding thermal performance and material cost. Also, several optimized lattice-structured designs outperform reference pin-fin-structured designs regarding thermal performance though the pin-fin structure is still advantageous for a material cost-oriented design. This paper also discusses the flow mechanism observed in the heat sink to explain how the optimized heat sink structure satisfies the competing design objectives simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Solving conjugate heat transfer design problems is relevant for various engineering applications requiring efficient thermal management. Heat exchange between fluid and solid can be enhanced by optimizing the system layout and the shape of the flow channels. As heat is transferred at fluid/solid interfaces, it is crucial to accurately resolve the geometry and the physics responses across these interfaces. To address this challenge, this work investigates for the first time the use of an {eXtended} Finite Element Method ({XFEM}) approach to predict the physical responses of conjugate heat transfer problems considering turbulent flow. This analysis approach is integrated into a level set-based optimization framework. The design domain is immersed into a background mesh and the geometry of fluid/solid interfaces is defined implicitly by one or multiple level set functions. The level set functions are discretized by higher-order B-splines. The flow is predicted by the Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Turbulence is described by the Spalart–Allmaras model and the thermal energy transport by an advection–diffusion model. Finite element approximations are augmented by a generalized Heaviside enrichment strategy with the state fields being approximated by linear basis functions. Boundary and interface conditions are enforced weakly with Nitsche’s method, and the face-oriented ghost stabilization is used to mitigate numerical instabilities associated with the emergence of small integration subdomains. The proposed {XFEM} approach for turbulent conjugate heat transfer is validated against benchmark problems. Optimization problems are solved by gradient-based algorithms and the required sensitivity analysis is performed by the adjoint method. The proposed framework is illustrated with the design of turbulent heat exchangers in two dimensions. The optimization results show that, by tuning the shape of the fluid/solid interface to generate turbulence within the heat exchanger, the transfer of thermal energy can be increased.},
